                In a phone message to the Western Producer, a commission spokesperson said the licence was revoked as of
                12:01 a.m. July 23.
                The commission’s website will be updated today to change the status of the Saskatoon grain dealer, which
                serves the food,
                pet food and animal food industries. The company has bought and sold most of the grains produced in
                Western Canada,
                including pulses, oilseeds and cereals. <br><br>

            <h2>Green, farm-produced anhydrous ammonia in the home stretch</h2><br>
            In mid-June, Ontario clean energy company FuelPositive announced that pieces were in place for its pilot
            project at R&L
            Acres near Sperling, Man. Why it matters: Aside from reducing emissions, producing anhydrous ammonia on the
            farm could
            shield farmers from volatile markets and supply issues.“We did the site prep this year right after seeding,”
            said Curtis
            Hiebert, who owns R&L Acres along with his wife, Tracy. “The system’s here now. Everything is here to make
            ammonia.
            They’re just connecting everything together and we’re waiting for (Manitoba) Hydro to get power in for us.
            That’s where
            we stand right now.”<br><br>
